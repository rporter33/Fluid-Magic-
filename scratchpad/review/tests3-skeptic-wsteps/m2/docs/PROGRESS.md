# Progress

## Phase 0: Scaffold (done)

- Vite 8 + React 18 + TypeScript 6 (strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), ESLint
  (typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked`, react-hooks), Prettier, Vitest. PixiJS 8,
  Zustand, idb-keyval, and d3-delaunay are installed but not used yet.
- Scripts: `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `format`, `sim:aivai`.
  `typecheck` runs a second pass over pure code without DOM/Node types; `lint` runs
  ESLint and `prettier --check`.
- `src/sim/rng.ts` (xoshiro128**), `src/sim/drn.ts` (open-ended 2d6), `src/sim/ids.ts`
  (counter ids with branded types), with tests for reference vectors, distribution
  sanity, determinism, and JSON round trips.
- `src/content/colors.ts` (five colors, palettes, enemy and allied pairs) and
  `src/content/terrain.ts` (seven terrains with base values and fills), checked by
  `tests/content/validate.test.ts`.
- Purity guard for sim, mapgen, and content (see the end of `docs/06-architecture.md`).
- The app shell renders a placeholder title screen.

## Deviations from the docs

- TypeScript is pinned to 6.0 because typescript-eslint does not support 7 yet.
- `sim:aivai` is a stub that validates its arguments; the runner arrives in Phase 6.

## Known issues and open questions

- `docs/01-core-rules.md` says capitals start on Farmland or Plains, but Thornwood's
  capital Deepmoss is listed as Forest in `docs/03-nations.md`. To settle in Phase 1/2.
