# Progress

## Phase 0: Scaffold (done)

- Vite 8 + React 18 + TypeScript 6 (strict, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`), ESLint
  (typescript-eslint `strictTypeChecked`, react-hooks), Prettier, Vitest. PixiJS 8,
  Zustand, idb-keyval, and d3-delaunay are installed but not used yet.
- Scripts: `dev`, `build`, `preview`, `test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `format`, `sim:aivai`.
  `typecheck` runs a second pass over pure code without DOM/Node types; `lint` runs
  ESLint and `prettier --check`.
- `src/sim/rng.ts` (xoshiro128**), `src/sim/drn.ts` (open-ended 2d6), `src/sim/ids.ts`
  (counter ids with branded types), with tests for reference vectors, distribution
  sanity, determinism, and JSON round trips.
- `src/content/colors.ts` (five colors, palettes, enemy and allied pairs) and
  `src/content/terrain.ts` (seven terrains with base values and fills), checked by
  `tests/content/validate.test.ts`.
- Purity guard for sim, mapgen, and content (see the end of `docs/06-architecture.md`).
- The app shell renders a placeholder title screen.

## Phase 1: Map and provinces (done)

- `src/mapgen/`: `generateMap({ seed, size, capitals })` builds a `MapData`. Steps: Poisson
  disc sites, two Lloyd rounds, Voronoi cells via d3-delaunay clipped to a rounded rectangle,
  adjacency from shared borders, farthest-point capitals, terrain by rank from seeded
  simplex noise, Wellsprings, springs, independent strength, starting population, and
  syllable names per terrain. `validateMap` checks every rule; generation retries
  deterministically when an attempt fails it.
- `src/content/`: `mapgen.ts` (map sizes and every generation number), `names.ts` (name
  syllables), `pretenders/scales.ts` (the five scale axes; costs and effects come in Phase 6).
  `src/sim/rng.ts` gained `weightedIndex`.
- Tests: one file per mapgen module, plus end-to-end checks on 20 Medium seeds and on
  Small, Large, 3-nation, and 4-nation maps. These cover connectivity, capital spacing,
  exact province count, at least 2 neighbors, springs coverage and parity, Wellspring
  distance and separation, exact terrain shares, drawn borders matching adjacency, and
  determinism. All are measured with helpers independent of `src/mapgen`.
- An adversarial review (6 lenses, 2 skeptics per finding) confirmed 20 findings, and all
  of them are fixed. Among them: adjacency now matches the drawn borders, terrain shares
  stay exact with capitals, capitals are shuffled into nation slots, spring colors are
  dealt evenly (Green had 2.5x Red's springs), and Wellspring placement is never adjacent
  and is fair for 3-4 nations. Mutation checks confirmed that the strengthened tests catch
  each of these regressions.
- Terrain fills and the Red and Green mana colors were replaced so every pair is clearly
  distinct, also for color blind players (CIEDE2000 at least 20 normally, 12 under simulated
  protanopia, deuteranopia, tritanopia). The new values are in `docs/09-art-direction.md`,
  and `tests/content/palette.test.ts` enforces the rule.
- Generation over 200 seeds per configuration had no failures. Medium 2-nation maps take
  about 20 ms; 4-nation maps take up to about 0.4 s.

## Deviations from the docs

- TypeScript is pinned to 6.0 because typescript-eslint does not support 7 yet.
- `sim:aivai` is a stub that validates its arguments; the runner arrives in Phase 6.
- Map rules settled in Phase 1 (province count by size and nation count, capital terrain
  from the nation, Wellspring separation and fairness, even spring colors, and more) are
  listed at the end of `docs/01-core-rules.md`. Their numbers are in `docs/09-balance.md`.

## Known issues and open questions

- Resolved: Thornwood's capital Deepmoss is Forest. Capitals take their terrain from the
  nation, overriding the core rules' "Farmland or Plains" (see `docs/01-core-rules.md`).
- Capital neighborhoods are balanced to within 1.5x starting population on about 99% of
  2-nation maps. With 3-4 nations the most even of 6 valid maps is often 1.5x to 2.5x.
  Revisit in Phase 12 if playtests show lopsided starts.
- Wellspring fairness is exact on 2- and 3-nation maps and within 1 hop on 4-nation maps.
- A dead elevation noise field would not fail any test; terrain wiring is covered only by
  exact shares and clustering. Pinning one seed's terrain would catch it but would churn on
  every deliberate generator change.
- For later phases: `wellspringsToWin` (majority of Wellsprings) lives in
  `src/mapgen/placement.ts`; Phase 6 victory should reuse it. The docs give independent
  troop pools for plains, forest, hills, mountains, and swamp but not for farmland or
  wasteland (Phase 3).
